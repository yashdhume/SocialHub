SocialHub

The goal of our website, is to aggregate a content creators social media posts from across the web. Instead of having to navigate between dozens of different sites, SocialHub gives you a single feed with all of your favorite creators posts, pulled from all the major social media sites. 

The first step of our process is the API calls, which pull data from across the web. This happens dynamically when a search is entered. For users that sign up with the site, you are able to create preset searches. These presets let you manually enter the channel/profile names across social media sites (incase of different names), and quickly search your favorite content creators. 

There is also a "customer support" box on the main page which supports live chat features.
